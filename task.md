# Task Management for Claude Automation

## Current Tasks

###  Completed Tasks
- [x] Set up project structure and directories
- [x] Create environment configuration (`.env`) 
- [x] Implement main project generator script (`scripts/generate_next.py`)
- [x] Set up GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/auto.yml`)
- [x] Create requirements.txt with necessary dependencies
- [x] Update documentation files (plan.md, task.md)

### =€ Next Steps
- [ ] Generate first sample project to test the system
- [ ] Initialize Git repository and configure remote
- [ ] Set up GitHub repository secrets for API keys
- [ ] Test manual workflow dispatch
- [ ] Monitor automated generation schedule

## Technical Implementation Details

### Scripts/generate_next.py Features
-  Support for both Anthropic (Claude) and OpenAI APIs
-  Random field selection from 14 programming domains
-  Automatic folder naming with UTC dates
-  Robust prompt engineering for project generation
-  File parsing from AI responses using regex
-  Git integration for automatic commits
-  Error handling and logging

### GitHub Actions Workflow Features
-  Scheduled execution (daily + every 5 hours)
-  Manual dispatch capability
-  Python 3.11 environment setup
-  Dependency installation
-  Git configuration
-  Environment variable management
-  Automatic pushing to main branch

### Environment Configuration
-  API key management for both providers
-  Provider selection flexibility
-  Model configuration options
-  Security through environment variables

## Quality Targets

Each generated project should include:
- [ ] 200-600 lines of code
- [ ] Non-trivial algorithmic logic
- [ ] Complete README with setup instructions
- [ ] Working test suite
- [ ] Minimal external dependencies
- [ ] Build/deployment configuration
- [ ] Sample data or fixtures (if applicable)

## Deployment Checklist

### Repository Setup
- [ ] Initialize git repository
- [ ] Add remote GitHub repository
- [ ] Configure GitHub repository secrets:
  - [ ] ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
  - [ ] OPENAI_API_KEY
- [ ] Set repository variables (optional):
  - [ ] PROVIDER
  - [ ] MODEL_NAME

### Testing
- [ ] Test local execution: `python scripts/generate_next.py`
- [ ] Verify file generation and parsing
- [ ] Test both API providers
- [ ] Validate git commit functionality
- [ ] Test GitHub Actions workflow

### Monitoring
- [ ] Set up notifications for workflow failures
- [ ] Monitor API rate limits and costs
- [ ] Track project generation success rates
- [ ] Review generated project quality regularly
