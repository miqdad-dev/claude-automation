# Machine Learning/AI Mini-Hard Project

This project trains a neural network model to predict the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measures.

## How It Works

The program uses a Keras model with a sequential architecture, and trains it on a dataset of patient records. The model is then tested on a separate dataset to predict the onset of diabetes.
